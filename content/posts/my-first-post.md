## Objective
To educate elderly individuals in my local community about recognizing and protecting themselves from phone and online scams, enhancing their cyber safety and security.

## Background
Inspired by a conversation with my mother about a vulnerable elderly customer who had experienced a scam call, I decided to offer support to local elderly people who may be at risk. Many elderly individuals live in my neighborhood, and I felt it was important to use my knowledge of cyber safety to assist them.

## Action Taken
- **Developed a Presentation:** I created a PowerPoint presentation on cyber safety, focusing on common scams and how to recognize them, both on the phone and online.
- **Collaborated for Improvement:** I sought the expertise of a neighbor who is skilled in teaching and using PowerPoint to review and enhance the presentation.
- **Delivered Talks:** I presented the talk at five events across four different locations, including sheltered accommodation homes where many elderly individuals reside.
- **Q&A Sessions:** After each talk, I conducted a Q&A session, answering participants' questions and providing additional advice on staying safe online.
- **Educational Materials:** I produced and distributed free stickers and information packs for the elderly attendees. The stickers featured safety reminders like “Caution, Confirm, Call” and included the contact details for the Action Fraud Helpline, giving the elderly a visual prompt to help them remember the steps to take if they suspect a scam.

## Recognition and Impact
- **Positive Feedback:** Audience members expressed gratitude for the talk and reported feeling more confident in identifying scams.
- **Media and Community Support:** My talks were shared on social media by local organizations, including the Liberal Democrat Facebook page, with a post from the local councillor, *Alun Griffiths*, and on elderly accommodation pages.
- **Commendations:** I received a personal thank-you call from a senior staff member of Anchor Housing, who had heard about my efforts through the local councillor.
- **Award:** I was awarded recognition from my school for my initiative and impact within the community.

## Outcome
The talks have raised awareness about cyber safety, empowered elderly individuals to protect themselves from scams, and fostered a sense of security within the community. I am committed to continuing these efforts and expanding the reach of this important educational initiative.
